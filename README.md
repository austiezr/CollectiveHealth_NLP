# CollectiveHealth_NLP
A short notebook to do some basic scraping and naive Natural Language Processing on the Collective Health blog.

This notebook was part of my interview prep process for Collective Health;\
I wanted to get a broad idea of company culture and values, in the words of the people working there.

I scraped text from a number of employee-interview articles, combined the text into a single corpus,\
pulled together a summary of most-important sentences by weighted term frequency.
